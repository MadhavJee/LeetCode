📌 485. Maximum Consecutive Ones
📝 Description

Given a binary array nums (containing only 0s and 1s), return the maximum number of consecutive 1s in the array.

📥 Example

Input:
nums = [1,1,0,1,1,1]

Output:
3

Explanation:
The first two 1s are consecutive, but the longest sequence is the last three 1s.

⚙️ Approach

Traverse the array once and keep counting consecutive 1s.
Reset the count to 0 whenever a 0 appears.
Track the maximum count during traversal.

Time Complexity: O(n)
Space Complexity: O(1)

💻 C++ Solution
class Solution {
public:
    int findMaxConsecutiveOnes(vector<int>& nums) {
        int c = 0;
        int ans = 0;
        for (int i=0;i<nums.size();i++ {
            if (nums[i] == 1) {
                c++;
                ans = max(ans, c);
            } else {
                c = 0;
            }
        }

        return ans;
    }
};
